# 💧 Dropout Regularization in Neural Networks

## 📘 Overview

This notebook explores the concept of **Dropout**, a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. By randomly "dropping" neurons during training, Dropout forces the model to learn more robust features and generalize better on unseen data.

We compare models with and without Dropout layers to illustrate the impact on training and validation performance.
